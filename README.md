# Malaysia COVID-19 Graph Data

This project downloads Malaysia COVID-19 data, generates a graph from the data, and serves the graph using a Flask web application.

## Project Structure

- **`download.py`**: Downloads the CSV file containing COVID-19 data from [MOH's Open Data](https://data.moh.gov.my/).
- **`graph.py`**: Draws a graph using the data from the downloaded CSV file.
- **`webapp.py`**: Deploys the graph in a Flask web application for easy access and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- The following Python libraries:
  - `Flask`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `requests`

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install Flask matplotlib pandas requests
```

### How to Run

1. **Download the COVID-19 Data**

   Run the `download.py` script to download the latest COVID-19 data:

   ```bash
   python download.py
   ```

2. **Generate the Graph**

   Use `graph.py` to process the downloaded data and generate a graph:

   ```bash
   python graph.py
   ```

3. **Deploy the Web Application**

   Finally, deploy the graph as a web app using Flask by running:

   ```bash
   python webapp.py
   ```

   The web app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
